Qt Creator Wizard Templates
===========================

These are used to create simple and correct base example projects etc. They are made to
encourage:

* experimentation, and
* posing and answering SO code questions with self-contained, valid, compileable examples.

To install the templates:

1. Locate the destination folder - create it if it doesn't exist.

 * `%APPDATA%\QtProject\qtcreator\templates` on Windows,
 * `~/.config/QtProject/qtcreator/templates` on Unix and OS X.

2. Link or copy each of the folders here to the folder above.
