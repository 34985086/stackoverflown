Qt Creator Wizard Templates
===========================

These are used to create simple and correct base example projects etc. They are made to
encourage:

* experimentation, and
* posing and answering SO code questions with self-contained, valid, compileable examples.

Link or copy each of the folders here to your creator's `shared/templates/wizards`
(Windows/Linux) or `Resources/templates/wizards` (OS X, within the app bundle).
